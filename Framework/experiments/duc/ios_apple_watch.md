## Health Data Parameters Tested

*Check all that apply:*

- [X] Heart Rate
- [X] Heart Rate Variable 
- [ ] Other: _______

## Test Procedure

1. **Setup**
    - _Description of how the test environment was prepared_
   ```
      The test environment was prepared through charging of devices and preparation of additional software needed for 
      the ability to synchronize data between apple watch series 9 and health kit on IOS. The smartwatch was also
      inspected for any visible damage or hinder of sensors that might affect the ability to provide data.
   ```

2. **Data Collection Process**
    - _Steps taken to collect the health data_
   ```
   The Apple Watch Series 9 was worn on the left wrist throughout the day to collect heart rate and heart rate variability data during resting and walking activities.
   The test application, built using the Flutter plugin, was installed on the iPhone 13 Pro. The plugin accessed Apple HealthKit to retrieve the health data collected by the Apple Watch.
   Once permissions was verified for the given metrics, the test app initiated a data request and successfully fetched available records for the selected metrics.
   ```

3. **Observations During Testing**
    - _Any notable observations during the testing process_
   ```
      
   ```

## Results

### Data Extraction Performance
