## Health Data Parameters Tested

*Check all that apply:*

- [X] Heart Rate
- [X] Heart Rate Variable 
- [ ] Other: _______

## Test Procedure

1. **Setup**
    - _Description of how the test environment was prepared_
   ```
   The smartwatch was inspected for any visible damage or hinder of sensors that might affect the ability to provide data. The FitBit
   was charged in beforehand and attached to the left wrist. 
   ```

2. **Data Collection Process**
    - _Steps taken to collect the health data_
   ```
      The plugin experiment app was installed on my Samsung Galaxy S22 aswell as Health Sync, which is a third party app
      needed for data synchronization between the Garmin Venu 2 and Health Connect. Then i synchronized gathered data via
      Health Sync from the smartwatch to the device. After synchronization of the registered data, i initialized the experiment
      within the experiment app for extraction of the data.
   ```

3. **Observations During Testing**
    - _Any notable observations during the testing process_
   ```
      
   ```
