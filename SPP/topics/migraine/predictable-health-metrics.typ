= Stress
== Heart rate
Fundamental stress indicator.
- Heart rate increase of about 7 beats/min indicate stress.  @quantifying-stress-and-relaxation
- High stress group has have higher resting heart rates. @heart-rate-variability-percieved-stress
== Heart rate variability
Sensitive marker of autonomic balance. Controlled experiments consistently show HRV drops during acute stress.
- HRV reduction during stress is a well replicated effect. @quantifying-stress-and-relaxation
- Tends to rebound as the individual recovers. @quantifying-stress-and-relaxation
- People experience ongoing stress often show lower resting HRV and higher percieved stress correlate with lower HRV. @heart-rate-variability-percieved-stress
== Electrodermal activity (Skin conductance)
Measures sweat gland activity, which is governed by sympathetic nerves.
Research has shown EDA to be one of the most responsive and reliable wearable metrics for stress.
- EDA based wearable models achieved an average classification accuracy of 83% for detecting percieved stress. @wearables-measuring-eda-assess-stress-in-care
- Has been explored for detecting pre-surgery anxiety and stress in patients via wristband. @detection-and-monitoring-of-stress-using-wearables
== Skin temperature
During acute stress, the body prioritize blood flow to core organs and muscles, often causing peripheral vasoconstriction that cools the skin in the extremities.
- Changes in skin temperature are more subtle than heart rate or EDA changes, and thus can be incorporated as supporting indicator in stress detection algorithms. @detection-and-monitoring-of-stress-using-wearables
== Respiration rate (breathing)
Respiration rate and breathing patterns are closely tied to stress levels. Acute stress triggers faster, shallower breathing, while relaxed states feature slower, deep breaths.
- It has been shown that during a stressful task 80% of individuals experience an increase in breathing rate.
