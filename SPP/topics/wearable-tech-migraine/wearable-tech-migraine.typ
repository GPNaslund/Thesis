@sleep-time-data
Early symtoms are highly personal due to the fact that user independent recognition models cannot detect migraine attacks.
Personal models performed better and could more reliably predict migraine attacks.

@feasibility-SMARTER-pediatric-migraine
Took measurements of skin conductance and activity through accelerometer. Studied the feasability of collecting autonomous (from wearables) and patient-filled-in reports about headache.

@exploring-associations-collected-tracker-data-and-headache-burden
Measured the burden of headache through wearables. Days with headache or migraine were associated with reduced daily step count, decreased proportion of the day spent active, increased daytime napping, maximum heart rate was lower, stepcount was decreased for the people suffering from migraine (but not tension related headache)
