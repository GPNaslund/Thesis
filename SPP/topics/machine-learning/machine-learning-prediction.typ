- Used wearable "Empatica Embrace Plus"
- Measured:
  - Pulse rate / Heart rate
  - Pulse rate variability / Heart rate variability
  - Respiratory rate
  - Sleep detection
  - Activity count, continous estimation of movement intensity measured in arbitrary amount
  - Accelerometer magnitude standard deviation
  - Step count
  - Continous estimation of energy consumption during physical activity
  - Continous monitoring of the participants skin conductance
  - Wearing detection
- The top 3 most important data points were: EDA, pulse rate and skin temperature
- Highlights the the shorter analyis frames (5 and 10 min) in capturing pre-migraine abnormalities
- The authors also suggest that future studies should incorporate a wider range of migraine triggers.

- Small surface electromyography sensor was used for measuring muscle tension from the upper trapezius
- A combined thermistor and photoplethysmography was attached to right index finger to measure peripheral skin temperature and heart rate.
- The model correctly predicts the absence or presence of headache the next day on almost two out of three occasions in unseen individuals.
- Self reported headache parameters, premonitory symptoms and physiological measurements all play a significant role.
