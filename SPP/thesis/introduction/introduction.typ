= Introduction

This thesis is a 15 HEC Master's thesis in Software Engineering. It explores the domain of mobile application development, wearable health technology, and data normalization. As healthcare becomes increasingly more digital, wearable devices like smartwatches and fitness trackers are gaining traction as tools for collecting physiological and behavioral data.

The widespread adoption and acceptance of such devices offers insightful possibilities for health monitoring, especially for conditions like migraine that could benefit from health monitoring. However, as of today that landscape is flawed due to data formats and APIs beeing differently interpreted depending on the different providers, making it difficult to integrate health data across platforms or use it effectively in research and machine learning.

This thesis aims to investigate this challenge and contributes by exploring how a mobile software framework solution might help unify and normalize health data from various sources. The aim is to simplify data handling for researchers and developers while also hopefully enabling more effective use of health data in fields such as machine learning.
